Felperin noted British reverse snobbery would put many off this and other Curtis films, but that this would be less of a problem among American Anglophiles and those willing to suspend disbelief, taking the characters as British \"versions of Woody Allen's Manhattanites (but with less angst)\". Felperin praised the chemistry of the leading couple \"that keeps the film aloft\" and the supporting cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar.\n",

            "text:The philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in \"Time Travel Paradoxes\" that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Ross uses the film \"Somewhere in Time\" as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that entropy of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a statistical law, so decreasing entropy and non-increasing entropy are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.\n",

While the film does refer to real concepts from physics, among them annihilation, the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, the grandfather paradox, and Feynman and Wheeler's Absorber Theory, Nolan stated in the film's press notes that \"we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate\". Commenting on the scientific aspects of writing the script, he stated: \"I think the scientific method is the best tool we have for analysing and understanding the world around us ... I've been very inspired by working with great scientists like Kip Thorne, who I worked with on \"Interstellar\", who also helped me out with some early analysis of the ideas I wanted to explore to do with time and quantum physics on \"Tenet\", although I promised him I wasn't going to bandy his name around as if there was some kind of scientific reality to \"Tenet\".
